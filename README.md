# Choice-Optimizing-Neural-Network
#### Neural Network for 'greater good' choice optimization for decision problems.

This project is a WIP. I'm building it to expand off my other neural network, but making the code significantly cleaner this time. My goal is to make a neural network that can decide the best-case-scenario for a group of people who rank items. Specifically, given 100 people and 10 different 'items' to choose from, you have each person rank their top 3 then feed that data into the neural network which will seek to give everyone the best choice possible assuming there is scarcity between the items. 

This could be used to have a neural network sign people up for college courses, or other things where there's scarcity and different people have different top choices for what they want. I was inspired to make this when myself and my 6 other roomates were trying to figure out who got what rooms in our house and each ranked the rooms 1-7.
